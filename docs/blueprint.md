# **App Name**: RohanBC.ai

## Core Features:

- Interactive Portfolio: A landing page showcasing Rohan BC's profile, skills, and projects with smooth scroll-based navigation to different sections: Home, About, Skills, Projects, Blog, Experience, Certifications, and Contact.
- Dynamic Project Showcase: Dynamic project cards displaying project details and technologies used. Project information is loaded from local files or a similar no-database approach.
- AI-Powered Bio Generator: AI-powered 'About Me' section.  The LLM tool reasons about the provided resume details and generates a personalized and engaging summary of Rohan BC's experience and skills.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark background (#121212) for a modern and sophisticated feel.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#E0E0E0) for text and subtle elements to ensure readability.
- Accent: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) to highlight interactive elements and create a futuristic tech-inspired vibe.
- Clean, minimal layout with generous spacing to allow content to breathe.
- Use a set of consistent, modern icons for navigation and section headers.
- Subtle scroll-based animations (e.g., fade-in, slide-in) to create a dynamic and engaging user experience. Use framer motion for animations.

## Original User Request:
Create a modern, responsive, and visually stunning personal portfolio website for Rohan BC, an AI and Robotics engineer. The site should have a futuristic tech-inspired design with a clean, minimal layout and vibrant accent colors like electric blue, deep violet, or cyber green. It should include dynamic components such as a hero section with animated background, a typewriter or morphing text headline, a real-time project showcase loaded from Firestore, smooth scroll-based animations (AOS or Framer Motion style), and a sticky navbar with scroll spy. The sections should be: Home, About, Skills, Projects (dynamic), Blog, Experience, Certifications, and Contact. Add interactive cards for projects, floating particle or mesh effects in the background, a dark/light mode toggle, and animated transitions between sections. The UI should be responsive, retina-ready, and optimized for fast loading. Use modern web design principles similar to Apple, Tesla, or OpenAI sites

 Projects
 MotionAI: Intelligent Motion Analysis for Athlete Training | Python, MediaPipe, ConvLSTM, PhyphoxApr. 2025
 • Developed an AI-powered system for real-time athletic motion analysis using pose estimation (MediaPipe) and
 sensor fusion (accelerometer/gyroscope).
 • Designed a hybrid ConvLSTM model achieving 92.39% accuracy in classifying 10 athletic actions (e.g., push-ups,
 boxing) from the UCF101 dataset.
 • Integrated smartphone sensors via Phyphox for multi-modal tracking and implemented Dynamic Time Warping
 (DTW) for form deviation detection.
 • Built an interactive 3D visualization (OpenGL) and AI coaching feedback system using Gemini AI for real-time
 corrective guidance.
 Emotional Analysis of Audio Using Deep Learning | Python, TensorFlow, Librosa
 Jan 2024
 • Developed a deep learning-based system for real-time classification of emotions (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger)
 from audio.
 • Key Components: Feature Extraction: Used MFCCs and Mel spectrograms via Librosa. Model: Hybrid 1D
 CNN-LSTM architecture for temporal and spatial analysis. Enhancements: Data augmentation (pitch shifting,
 noise injection) for robustness.
 • Datasets: Trained on RAVDESS, TESS, CREMA-D, and SAVEE for diverse emotional representation.
 Applications: Empathetic AI, customer sentiment analysis, and mental health diagnostics. Outcome: High
 accuracy and noise resilience, adaptable for real-world applications.
